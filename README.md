# Natural language processing course: `Integrating Structured Knowledge into Large Language Models`



This repository contains the coursework for the NLP course at the University of Ljubljana, focusing on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes experiments, related work, and findings presented in Jupyter notebooks and associated documentation.

Knowledge graphs structure data as entities (nodes) and their explicit relationships (edges), allowing systems to understand how things are connected and reason over this information. They excel at providing context, performing logical reasoning, and supporting complex queries involving multiple entities and relationships.

On the other hand, vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of information, focusing on similarity-based retrieval. While vector representations are ideal for fast, scalable searches through unstructured data (like text or images), they lack the explicit, interpretable connections that knowledge graphs provide.

In short, knowledge graphs with LLMs offer deeper understanding and reasoning through clear relationships, while vector databases are optimized for fast, similarity-based searches without needing to know how items are related.
